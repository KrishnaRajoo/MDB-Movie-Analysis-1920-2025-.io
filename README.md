# 🎬 Data Analysis on Top Rated Movies

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **Top Rated Movies** using Python. The dataset contains movie details such as title, release year, genre, ratings, votes, and other metadata. The analysis explores patterns and trends in the film industry, identifying insights such as:

* Which genres are most popular?
* How ratings have evolved over the years.
* Correlation between votes and ratings.
* Distribution of movies across decades.

The project uses **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive data analysis and visualization.
